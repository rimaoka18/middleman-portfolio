        <h2>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>Before transitioning into tech, I spent 10 years studying in the US, followed by working at a marketing firm where I handled sales, customer service, and led a team. These experiences sharpened my ability to work with diverse groups, solve complex problems, and maintain a customer-focused mindsetâ€”skills that I now apply to my work as a web developer. Recently, I graduated from Le Wagon Tokyoâ€™s full-time full-stack web development bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in building web applications. I am currently learning JavaScript and React, and Iâ€™m actively seeking a full-stack developer role where I can continue growing and contributing to impactful projects. I'm passionate about creating user-centered solutions and collaborating with teams to build innovative products. I also look forward to mentoring aspiring developers in the future. In my free time, I enjoy watching baseball, going to the gym, and hiking.</p>
